# Socket
This is a small project on sockets and communication between a server and multiple clients connected to it

# Description
- The server runs on an IP and a port and waits for socket client connections.
- The client connects to the server and can send messages to all the other connected clients.

# Use Cases
- This small project can be used to host a private chat room only if they do not know th IP ;)
- The clients connect to the server and can send/receive messages from other clients.
- The server script can also run on a AWS EC2 Instance, and people can connect from any part of the world
